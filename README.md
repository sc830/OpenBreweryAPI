### Project ###
In this project, I was given a minimal set of files and tasked with integrating OpenBrewery API into a Python application. The app allows the user to navigate through several menus to build an API query based on the user's choices, then displays the desired info to the console.

### Features ###
# API Integration: Implemented functionality to query OpenBrewery's API to acquire brewery information.
# User Input: Allows user to build API query
# Current Information: Acquires data from OpenBrewery on each run, ensuring up-to-date information every time.

### Getting Started ###
Clone this repository to your device. Create an account and API key for TMDB at https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs. Create a .env file in the root directory that defines TMDB_API_KEY as your API key. Compile and run fetch_n_print_movies.py.

### Skill Development ###
# API Integration: Gained hands-on experience in integrating external APIs into Java applications. Data Manipulation: Practiced handling and manipulating JSON data obtained from API responses.
# User-defined variables: dynamically built API query based on user input
# Data Sorting: Organized and parsed data in JSON format.

Acknowledgements Special thanks to OpenBrewery. This project was built upon their API, and their documentation was instrumental in its successful implementation. And thanks to Ted Lehr, who provided a small amount of starter code for this project.
